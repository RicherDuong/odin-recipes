    <h2>How to cook ribeye steak</h2>
    <p>
      Rib eye steak can seem intimidating to cook, but this version couldn't be simpler. Based on a recipe from chef Alain Ducasse, the method has essentially two parts: seasoning the meat well and letting it stand at room temperature for half an hour, then cooking the steak in a hot cast-iron skillet. Former F&W senior food editor Mary-Frances Heck recommends a teaspoon of kosher salt per pound, about 2 1/2 teaspoons for this rib eye steak recipe.

      Halfway through cooking, the steaks are basted with a mixture of butter, thyme, rosemary, and garlic, so they're crusty outside and richly flavored. There's no need to chop herbs here; make sure to use whole garlic cloves so that they don't burn. We prefer unsalted butter, since the meat is already seasoned. And don't worry about any special equipment. For these rib eyes, all you need is a sturdy pan and a spoon. Though the recipe calls for a cast-iron skillet, a quality stainless steel one will also do the trick.

      Once you've achieved medium-rare status — a meat thermometer should read about 130°F — pull the steaks off the heat and transfer them to a cutting board for 10 minutes before slicing. As the meat rests, the temperature will continue to rise to that ideal 135°F, sealing in the juices.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 (1 1/4-pound) bone-in rib eye steaks</li>
      <li>Kosher salt</li>
      <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>4 thyme sprigs</li>
      <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
      <li>1 rosemary sprig</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Season the rib eye steaks all over with salt and freshly ground pepper. Let the meat stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>In a large cast-iron skillet, heat the canola oil until shimmering. Add the steaks and cook over high heat until crusty on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Turn the steaks and add the butter, thyme, garlic, and rosemary to the skillet. Cook over high heat, basting the steaks with the melted butter, garlic, and herbs, until the steaks are medium-rare, 5 to 7 minutes longer.</li>
      <li>Transfer the steaks to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes. Cut the steaks off the bone, then slice the meat across the grain and serve.</li>

    <h2>How to Make this Baked Salmon Recipe</h2>
    <p>
      Here's the thing. I really really love salmon. Enough that I've said a few times out loud that if I had to choose one type of animal-based protein to live on for the rest of my life, it would be salmon. I make a lot of chicken dishes, and I can put away a thick, juicy steak like it's nobody's business, but if it ever comes right down to it I'm choosing salmon. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I can't say I have a lot to say about this salmon, except that it is exactly what I'm calling it: Easy. Healthy. Baked. Well, and Salmon (of course). But there seriously could not be an easier recipe for baking up the most perfect, lemony, garlicky salmon every single time. I have loads of hugely popular salmon recipes here on Creme de la Crumb, from sweet and spicy Thai-inspired, to shrimp-smothered, and grilled in a foil pack with asparagus, but it is high time I gave you this super simple, straightforward, no-tricks-only-treats Easy Healthy Baked Salmon.     </p>
    <p>
      You're welcome.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Salmon Fillets</li>
      <li>Olive Oil</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Cracked Black Pepper</li>
      <li>Minced Garlic</li>
      <li>Italian herb Seasoning Blend</li>
      <li>Lemon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees and grease a large baking pan. Arrange the salmon fillets on the baking sheet and season generously with salt and pepper.</li>
      <li>Stir together the olive oil, garlic, herbs, and juice of 1/2 of the lemon. Spoon this sauce over salmon fillets, being sure to rub all over the tops and sides of the salmon so it has no dry spots. Thinly slice the remaining 1/2 of the lemon and top each piece of salmon with a slice of lemon.</li>
      <li>Bake the salmon in the oven for 12-15 minutes or until the salmon is opaque and flaky when pulled apart with a fork. You can broil the last 1-2 minutes if desired.</li>
      <li>Garnish with fresh thyme or parsley if desired and serve.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>How to bake chicken breasts</h2>
    <p>
      Over the years, I've received countless requests for new chicken breast recipes, and many more for tips on how to bake chicken breasts in the oven. Because anyone who worked with chicken breasts before know that they can be incredibly versatile, yet also incredibly finicky to work with, especially when baked in the oven. Cook them the wrong way and you'll end up with a dry, rubbery, tough, and flavorless disaster. But cooked the right way?! We're talkin' juicy, tender, flavorful, perfectly baked chicken breasts that you will love.
